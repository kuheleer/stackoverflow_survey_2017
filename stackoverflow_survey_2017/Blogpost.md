# Heading to one of the hottest career spotlight: Webdeveloper

*"The Web is about people first, technology second,"* says D. Keith Robinson, a Seattle-based Web designer.
*"Designing for the Web is more about communication and content than graphic design."*
These challenges creeping in with each day keeps this career quite exciting and stable in terms of both job satisfaction and financial income.
 
Some analysis based on the  the Stack Overflow 2017 Developer Survey suggests that Webdeveloper jobs stands out as the most common jobs while others viz, Desktop applications developer, Mobile developer, Database administrator, Developer with a statistics or mathematics background, Systems administrator, DevOps specialist, Embedded applications/devices developer, Data scientist follow.

Around 26235 people are into the job of webdevelopment while other have a count of around 10k and below.
Ever wondered what it would be like to put a little more into your knowledge hub and preparing urself to be under this trending spotlight of today? 

*Let’s Start Here – Website 101*
Back in the early days of the web, a static HTML file would have to be update­d for adding every new piece of information. This method works­ well for websites with limited information and infrequent updates, but what about websites like news websites that publishes a large amount of pages daily. 

A recent report published by atlantic shows that on average 200-500 stories are published each day.

Imagine creating 300 pages daily. Pretty cumbersome is it? 

Well, a easy way out is to utilize a database to store all of our articles and write a script to make the HTML retrive information from the database. We can begin to think of these as two entities viz, the back-end and front-end of our website. 

Now let’s get back to the main question we asked in the first place: What is the little more to enhance your knowledge hub and have the feather on the cap in the field of web development.
Although you are expected to have a knowledge that is a a culmination of many related languages, a look into the most commonly used languages is worth it.

A websearch on the the “common languages for webdevelopment” would have python, javascript, sql as one of the toppers in the list. However, the analysis from the stackoverflow survey 2017 provides a language vs. Salary figure which has added to the webresults. 
Following is the data pertaining to the figure above:

    - language       Salary
     -C#            58305.499895
     -Java          50635.552429
     -JavaScript    54929.947392
     -Python        66431.251978
     -SQL           55149.674974

Now that I have mentioned about the languages for webdevelopment, this blog would remain incomplete if the other bigger side remains unvisited. I  now approach the role of a full-stack web developer. A full-stack web developer has expertise in all layers or “STACK”s of a website’s development. This includes, but not limited to: the server, client and hosting, a form of data structuring or modeling, user interface and experience, as well as the needs of the actual business.

The count of webdevelopertype corresponding to the figure above is mentioned below:

    - Full stack Web developer    6816
    - Back-end Web developer      2610
    - Front-end Web developer     1270

Again, the fact of the scales being higher for full-stack developer is governed by the fact that it pulls a considerably more penny to ur pocket, as shown by the figure:

Conclusion:
The results obtained from the stackoverflow 2017 survey has undoubtedly provided some useful stats and figure regarding the trending jobs and the related languages and their respective salary.
